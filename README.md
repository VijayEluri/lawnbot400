# The Lawnbot400

The lawnbot400 is a remotely controlled lawnmower using the Arduino to decode R/C signals and control peripheral devices on the bot, like a remote cutoff-switch, remote motor kill-switch, lights, and an extra channel that can be used for a starter or a bucket lift motor.

There are different folders for different versions of code, and I try to comment stuff.
